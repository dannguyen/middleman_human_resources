description: |
  The visuals team (formerly known as news applications) is a crew of developers, designers, photojournalists and videographers in the newsroom at NPR headquarters in sunny Washington, DC — and we're hiring.

  We work closely with editors and reporters to create data-driven news applications (Playgrounds For Everyone), fun and informative websites (NPR's Book Concierge), web-native documentaries (Planet Money Makes A T-shirt), and charts and maps and videos and pictures and lots of things in-between.

  ### We believe strongly in…

  - User-centered design
  - Agile software development
  - Open-source software, and being transparent in our methods
  
  ### You must have…
  - Experience making things for the web (We've got a way we like to do things, but we love to meet folks with new talents!)
  - Attention to detail and love for making things
  - A genuine and friendly disposition

  ### Bonus points for…
  - An uncontrollable urge to write code to test your code
  - Love for making audio and video experiences that are of the web, not just on the web
  - Deep knowledge of Javascript and functional programming for the web
